# LaViMo
## LaViMo Web Videos
This is the LaViMo dataset repo. The URLs to web video could be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-DjOIwWQpwNhz8Z5h49uu3rL4lyLxc7v?usp=sharing) after getting approval. 
## LaViMo NTU120K Videos
The other portion of our LaViMo dataset comes from NTU120K. Please go to this [page](https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/).
## Motion Extractor HuMoR
HuMoR can extract high quality motions but might take quite a long time to preprocess a single video. Please go to this [page](https://github.com/davrempe/humor) for HuMoR model.
## Motion Extractor HyBriK
HyBriK is more efficient than HuMoR, however, the extracted 3D human motion might contain more distortue and jiggering. Please go to the [page](https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/HybrIK) for HyBriK model.
## Efficient Motion Extractor
TBD
